# Image-Classification
📌 Project Overview

This project is an Image Classification Web App built using Django and a pre-trained Machine Learning model. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 10 different object categories. The web application allows users to upload an image, and the system predicts its category.
🚀 Features

✅ Upload an image for classification
✅ Uses a trained model to predict the image category
✅ Provides real-time results with user-friendly UI
✅ Supports 10 classes from the CIFAR-10 dataset
✅ Built with Django for seamless backend processing
